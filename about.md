My name is Philipp Garbe and I work as a developer in Munich.

I started programming when I was a teen (some C++ but mostly VB). After .Net was first-time released I switched to C# and it is still my favourite language. But in the last couple of months I came more and more in contact with Ruby and F#. And not to forget my love-hate relationship with JavaScript. For almost all of my projects I use Git as version control and the more I work with it the more I love it.

For several years now, I have been working for a great [company](http://www.autoscout24.de) in Munich. We work in very agile teams and I have the freedom to experiment with techniques like CQRS, Event Sourcing and DDD. I also believe that [Continuous Delivery](http://continuousdelivery.com) (or [Continuous Deployment](http://continuousdelivery.com/2010/08/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment/) if possible) is fundamental for good teams and good products.
